This is my First Repo.
Basically I made a simple odometer for representing what it kind of means to be in Base 10. A professor really liked one she had at one point, so I made one to replace it.
Pretty easy to make. FLTK, C++, cmake. Maybe it's frowned upon to use Cmake. This is really my first time importing a library so yeah probably not the best but whatever.
